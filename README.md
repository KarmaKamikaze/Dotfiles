# Karma's Dotfiles
Dotfiles are the customization files (their filenames usually begin with a period) that are used to personalize your Linux or other Unix-based system. This repository contains my personal dotfiles. They are stored here for convenience so that I may quickly access them on new machines or new installs.

## Configs
- [Alacritty](https://github.com/KarmaKamikaze/Dotfiles/tree/master/.config/alacritty)
- [fish](https://github.com/KarmaKamikaze/Dotfiles/tree/master/.config/fish)
- [Starship](https://github.com/KarmaKamikaze/Dotfiles/blob/master/.config/starship.toml)
- [Termite](https://github.com/KarmaKamikaze/Dotfiles/tree/master/.config/termite)

### Additional configs
I use a collection of terminal color scripts accumulated by [Derek Taylor](https://gitlab.com/dwt1).
- [Shell Color Scripts](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/shell-color-scripts)
